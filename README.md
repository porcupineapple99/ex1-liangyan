# Project Name: Checkerboard Pattern

## Description
This project generates a checkerboard pattern using Python, and the script allows you to modify the pattern's size and colormap. It's a simple demonstration of how to use `matplotlib` and `numpy` to create graphical patterns.

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following Python packages installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these packages using `pip` if you donâ€™t have them installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/porcupineapple99/ex1-liangyan.git
   cd checkerboard.py
   ```

2. **Run the Python script**:

   To generate and view the checkerboard pattern, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python checkerboard.py
   ```

   This will generate and display a checkerboard pattern with a default size and colormap. You can modify the script to change the size of the checkerboard or the color map by adjusting the parameters in the `checkerboard.py` file.

3. **Optional: Modify the parameters**:
   - You can change the size of the checkerboard by modifying the `size` variable in the `generate_checkerboard()` function.
   - You can change the colormap in the `plt.imshow()` function by modifying the `cmap` argument.

## Example Usage

- To create a checkerboard with 10 squares and a `hot` colormap, modify the script as follows:

  ```python
  checkerboard = generate_checkerboard(size=100, num_squares=10)
  plt.imshow(checkerboard, cmap="hot", interpolation="nearest")
  ```

- Save the script and run it again to see the updated pattern.
